Sx4 is mainly based around it's economy system with many ways you can make money, you can get daily money where you can build up
streaks as long as you come back everyday to collect your daily money, the higher streak the more chance you have of being
rewarded a crate the higher the streak the higher chance of a better crate and a better reward. You can buy different pickaxes
which can give you a variety of materials at a max of 1 per material as well as some money, pickaxes have durability and always
guarentee profit with the added benefit of materials so the better the pickaxe the better the rewards, another way you can make
money easily is, fishing, by default you can fish and it will give you a random amount between $2 to $15 every 5 minutes as long as
you revisit the command every 5 minutes but you can buy rods with durability which give extra profit per fish so that you can make
extra money at the cost of the rod price.
A really effective way of collecting materials is miners you can buy them using the currency and they
give you a variety of materials but it's not limited to 1 material you can have multiple of the same (miners are stackable) and
then you can also gain materials through using your pickaxe and opening crates. With these materials you can purchase factories
these factories yield you money depending on how hard it is obtaining the factory (factories are also stackable), or you can even
sell your stuff on an online auction house built into the bot where you can also buy items off other users who also use the bot.
You can also get some bonus money by simply voting for the bot to rocket your start in the economy, make sure to vote every 12
hours as it's very profitable in the long run (If you give your referral links to friends you get bonus money just for referring them) and it doubles on weekends due to votes counting as 2 so double the reward!
